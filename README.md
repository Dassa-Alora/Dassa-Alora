- 👋 Hi, I’m Cassie aka @Dassa_Alora
- 👀 I’m interested in writing science fiction and fantasy stories. I also enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons as well as a variety of tabletop and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GitHub...? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is not programming. Maybe doing some quality assurance? 
- 📫 How to reach me dassa.alora@gmail.com
